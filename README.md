# About Me

My name is **Imaad Javaid**, a second-year BSc Physics student at **Loughborough University**.  
This portfolio showcases my Formula 1 race simulation projects, written in **Python** with Tkinter GUIs, data visualisation, and CSV export.  

The aim of these simulations is to demonstrate my passion for motorsport engineering, and my ability to combine **physics, coding, and data analysis** into working simulation tools.  
Each project is fully documented with screenshots, a user guide, and commented source code.

Additionally, I have created a simple front and rear wing in CAD , to demonstrate my modelling abilities and I have run CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations on said CAD models. The aim of this project was to merge my CAD skills with my passion for F1 by exploring aerodynamic design and performance analysis.

## Projects

### Tyre Degradation Simulator
- Models grip, wear, temperature, and pressure across a stint  
- Implements puncture logic and lap-time calculation  
- Visualises results with **Matplotlib graphs**  
- CSV export of full stint data

### Race Strategy Simulator
- Simulates a full race with multiple drivers, compounds, and pit stops  
- Live leaderboard with lap times and pit stop events  
- Tracks tyre wear, stint lengths, and strategy choices  
- Exports race results to CSV

### Race Engineer Virtual Console (REVC)
- Models tyre grip degradation, fuel weight, and driver modes  
- Interactive GUI with *Normal* / *Push* / *Save* modes  
- Allows pit stops & tyre changes mid-race  
- Real-time visualisation of lap times, grip, and tyre temperature  
- CSV export of full race data

### CAD wings wth CFD Simulations 
- Designed a front and rear wing in CAD 
- Ran CFD simulations to analyse airflow, pressure distribution, and aerodynamic efficiency.
- Commented the effect of geometry on downforce and drag coefficients.
- Produced visualisations (streamlines, surface friction and surface pressure maps) to communicate results.
